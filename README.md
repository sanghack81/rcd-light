Relational Causal Discovery Light (RCD-Light)

This adds a new algorithm called Relational Causal Discovery Light to the existing software Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) developed by developed by the Knowledge Discovery Laboratory at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst. The original software is
available from
  https://kdl.cs.umass.edu/display/public/Relational+Causal+Discovery
  
Packages under *causality* has some modified source files from RCD for added features and performance improvements.
Packages under *shlee* contains new sources for RCD-Light.
